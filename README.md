# Searching Example

This is a simple web page example that allows you to search for a specific word or phrase within a paragraph of text and highlights the matching results. The search is case-insensitive, meaning it will find matches regardless of the letter casing.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the HTML file.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. You will see a web page with a search input box and a "Search" button.

4. Type the word or phrase you want to search for in the search input box.

5. Click the "Search" button or press Enter to perform the search.

6. The web page will display the search results by highlighting the matching word(s) in yellow within the paragraph of text. The search results are case-insensitive.

7. If there are multiple matches, all of them will be highlighted.

8. If the search term is not found in the text, a "Not found" message will be displayed.

9. You can perform additional searches by entering a new search term and clicking the "Search" button. The previous highlights will be cleared before applying new highlights.
